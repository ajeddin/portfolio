## Inspiration
 My friend has struggled with managing appointments and prescriptions, and we wanted to create a solution to make the process easier.
## What it does
Having a sign up/login page for patients. 
Manages Prescriptions (adds/deletes) 
Tracks frequency of medication and dosage
View available doctor with their photo/specialty/working hours
Ability to create appointments with the selected doctors
## How we built it
We used javascript, html, css, postgreSql, express, axios, bit.io jwt, bycrypt.

## Challenges we ran into
Writing SQL queries with the join feature , logic for available appointment time slots was also difficult
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We made interactive time slots for appointments
We designed an excellent front-end design 
We gave ability for the patient to input their current medication/prescription for them to easily manage them
## What we learned
We learned a lot about backend, frontend design, using advanced sql commands.

## What's next for HackHealth
Making the system more scalable to handle a larger number of patients and doctors.
Adding analytics and reporting functionality to track usage and identify areas for improvement.
Implementing machine learning algorithms to improve the functionality of the system.
Expanding the system to other countries or languages.
Integrating with other healthcare systems, such as electronic medical record systems.
Adding new features such as appointment reminders or telemedicine functionality.
